# 100Challenge
"The 100 Challenge" will feature My App Development Journey using Flutter, Dart and Firebase. This Challenge will continue on a 100 Days Streak and I'll follow a principle of "Never Miss Twice" which states that missing 1 time is an outlier in habit formation but Missing 2 Times is a beginning of a pattern of procrastination, I acknowledge this Human Tendency and I'll do my best to continue this streak. I'm Super Curious to Discover what will I become at the other side of this challenge? Join Me on My Journey and Let's Experiment with Powerful Application Experiences.
_This Github Repository will Host all My Codebase:_
#flutter #dart #firebase

##START DATE: 17/9/24
